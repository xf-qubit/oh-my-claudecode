/**
 * Event-driven team runtime v2 — replaces the polling watchdog from runtime.ts.
 *
 * Runtime selection:
 * - Default: v2 enabled
 * - Opt-out: set OMC_RUNTIME_V2=0|false|no|off to force legacy v1
 * NO done.json polling. Completion is detected via:
 * - CLI API lifecycle transitions (claim-task, transition-task-status)
 * - Event-driven monitor snapshots
 * - Worker heartbeat/status files
 *
 * Preserves: sentinel gate, circuit breaker, failure sidecars.
 * Removes: done.json watchdog loop, sleep-based polling.
 *
 * Architecture mirrors runtime.ts: startTeam, monitorTeam, shutdownTeam,
 * assignTask, resumeTeam as discrete operations driven by the caller.
